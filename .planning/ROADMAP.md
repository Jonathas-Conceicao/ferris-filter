## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: Config-driven styles (no hardcoded vocabulary) (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Any config should be able to define and use new named styles without a code change.
Today the style vocabulary is hardcoded in the `Styles` struct (`src/models/config.rs`) and
`emitter::resolve_style` (`src/emitter.rs`) — adding `craftable` (for `ssf_icewolf_config.json`)
required editing both. Replace the named-field `Styles` struct with a name→`Style` map (or keep
S–F/unchanged/hidden/unidentified as the known palette plus an open `extra` map), resolve styles
by lookup instead of a `match`, and validate at load-time that every `rule.style` resolves.
`FUTURE` comments already mark both code locations.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 planned (not yet scoped)

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd-review-backlog when ready)
